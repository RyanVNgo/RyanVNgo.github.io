A CHIP-8 emulator made in C.

![IBM logo test ROM running]({{ page.images[0] }})

This emulator was developed for the sake of learning and understanding the
core functionality of computer systems at a rudimentary level. I primarily
referenced [this page by mattmikolay](https://github.com/mattmikolay/chip-8/wiki/Mastering-CHIP%E2%80%908)
when developing the emulator and utilized [Timendus's CHIP-8 test suite](https://github.com/Timendus/chip8-test-suite/tree/main)
to evalute the functionality and accuracy of the emulator.
