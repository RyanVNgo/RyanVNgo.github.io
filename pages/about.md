# About
---

Current undergraduate at San Diego State University (2025).
Recently messing around with C/C++ alongside CUDA. Also familiar with Java, Python, and a bit of Go.
Interested in software/program optimization cause I hate it when shits slow. 
Outside of programming I'm also into tech, gaming, coffee, astrophotography, and K-pop. <sub>*(stan Aespa)*</sub>
