# Astro

My portfolio of astrophotography images I've taken since starting
in late 2021.

At the end of 2023, I took a break from the hobby to focus on
education and have not imaged since. In mid-2025, I had sold off
my mount and no longer have the capacity to image. However, I still
hold interest in the hobby and hope to return to it soon (I really
just need a new mount).

Unfortunately, a good amount of information regarding the capturing 
equipment and parameters for these photos have been lost so if some 
images contain little to no information, that is the reason why.
