    <h1>Ryan V. Ngo's Website</h1>

    <p>Welcome to my personal website.</p>
    
    <h3>There isn't much going on here but that's alright.</h3>

    <p>
      All you need to know is that I write code, and some pretty alright code at that.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you couldn't already tell, I don't do much web-development or front-end work.
      I like working close to the computer, the low-level kind of sttuff.
      From memory management to multi-threading, that's what I like. 
    </p>

    <p>
      With that being said, my goal is to make systems work <i>fast</i> and <i>efficiently</i>.
      <ul>
        <li>Balancing minimal and efficient memory usage</li>
        <li>Formulating custom built algorithms</li>
        <li>Designing performant multithreaded architectures</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
