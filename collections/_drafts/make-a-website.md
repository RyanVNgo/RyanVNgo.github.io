## Owning Your Content


## Not Just a Portfolio




## How To Have One

If you have the time available and willingness to learn something new, 
then I'd genuinely recommend learning how to code your own website.


### Website Builders

There are a handful of website builders, some of which you are likely
aware of, that provide an easier avenue for creating your own website.

Some of these sites include Wix, Squarespace, WordPress, and many others
that provide a zero-code approach to website building.

<blockquote class="blockquote-note">
    I don't have personal experience with any of the website builders 
    mentioned so if you are considering using any of them or those
    like them, then I highly suggest doing your own research to find 
    what will work best for you.

## Why I Have Mine

In the beginning, I created this website to serve as a portoflio of
my work, an extention of my resume and Github projects. That's still 
the case but my idea of its construction and content has changed with 
time.


## On Redesigning This One

If you look back on the commit history of site, you'll see the numerous 
changes I've made to the design of this website. I'm not a trained or 
practiced designer but I always feel compelled to make things look 
aesthetically pleasing, for my own work at least.
