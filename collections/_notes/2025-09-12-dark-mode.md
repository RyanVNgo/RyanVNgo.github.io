title: Dark Mode and JS

I finally added a light/dark mode switch. 

For so long I've been trying to avoid using JavaScript on this site when 
possible but a switch like this that persists a user's color scheme 
selection practically requires JS so it's here now.

I'll probably spend more time tweaking the colors and style of the site
so more updates coming soon.
