      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>
        My name is Ryan and I'm currently an undergraduate student at
        San Diego State University studying computer science. I like 
        programming, tech, astrophotography, and K-pop <i>(stan Aespa)</i>.
      </p>


      <h1>This Site</h1>

      <p>
        This was originally supposed to be a place to showcase projects and other
        stuff I'm working on that were relevant to comp-sci/programming, aka
        career stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, I've thought about creating content around my
        interests which expands into tech and astronomy. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I could make videos (any maybe I will) but they require a lot of work. So
        for now, I thought I'd just write articles about the things I've wanted
        to share and talk about. It's simple enough and I like writing, especially
        if I know it'll help someone out, whatever way that might be.
      </p>
      <p>
        On some technical notes, I've tried my best to minimize the footprint of
        the site in terms of resources and rendering so everything is quite
        minimal. It's just HTML, CSS, and a single JS script for content
        reusability.
      </p>
      <p>
        <s>I have an article discussing the reasons why I've created the site in this
          way so I won't go into it here but I suggest checking it out.</s>
