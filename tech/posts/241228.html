      <h1>Minimizing Page Weight</h1>
      <h3>24/12/28</h3>

      <p>
        Something I took consideration of when developing this website was
        the page weight. Page weight just refers to the total byte size of the page
        which can include the HTML, CSS, JS, images, videos, and whatever other
        files or services that need to be loaded for the page to function. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Shifting more of my development work to my Thinkpad X61T, a laptop from 2007,
        made me realize just how resource intensive a lot of sites on the web
        actually are.
      </p>
      <p>
        The median page weight has increased from just under 500kB in 2010 all the
        way to 2600kB in 2024. That's over five times the amount data being
        transferred per page with most of it consisting of images and JS. The result
        is longer load times and greater technical requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        This can be pretty annoying to users who are working on slower networks or have
        lower end hardware. Especially when a lot of these pages don't need to warrant
        so many resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I don't need to, I made it a goal for myself to minimize as much
        unnecessary weight as possible while still mantaining a good level of
        functionality and visual appeal. I ended up sticing to pure HTML and CSS,
        to the point that the site doesn't even include any JS.
      </p>
      <p>
        And while sure, the site doesn't have any cool or flashy interactivity, at
        the end of the day it gets the job done. The site has all the functionality I
        need and still looks somewhat visually appealing (at least to me).
      </p>
      <p>
        The site now sits at around 10kB per page which is far less than even
        sites from 2010. I could afford to make the design more complicated and
        interesting but I'm not a designer and can't be bothered to try right now.
      </p>
      <p>
        Things will probably get more complex once I decide to host the site myself
        instead of on Github but a lot of that will probably come from the web
        server itself and adding a system to handle these articles better.
      </p>
      <p>
        But until then, I like the way things are set up now and I hope to keep things
        as simple and minimal as possible for as long as possible.
      </p>
